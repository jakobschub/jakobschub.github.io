                  <h2>app review - Starhub happy prepaid</h2>
                </header>
                <p> For my first review I have chosen to examine <a target="_blank"
                    href="http://www.starhub.com/personal.html">Starhub</a>
                  and their mobile application <a target="_blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/sg/app/happy-prepaid/id981031677">Happy
                    Prepaid</a>. The app is for anyone with a Starhub prepaid
                  account and it enables you to manage your subscription.
                  Through the Happy Prepaid app you can view your credit and
                  data balance, set up phone for roaming, add different types of
                  plans and scroll through different promotions. I personally
                  use this app frequently and from a utility perspective I think
                  the app relieves a lot of everyday pains. The features I use
                  the most is checking my data balance, topping up my credit
                  balance and buying new data plans. The Happy Prepaid app meets
                  my demands and it has the functions most people use and need.
                  Information-wise the app does it's job. However, I have a few
                  concerns regarding the interface and responsiveness of the
                  app. More on that later. </p>

                <img src="file:///Users/schub/Documents/IT1001/Individual/webpage/template/images/example2.jpg"

                  style="margin-left: 30px;"><img
                  src="file:///Users/schub/Documents/IT1001/Individual/webpage/template/images/example3.jpg"
                  alt=""
                  style="margin-left: 35px;">
                <p> </p>
                <p> The pictures above are screenshots from my most frequently
                  used features of the app. The homepage, data purchase site and
                  the credit top up site. To reach the main menu, you press the
                  lines in the upper right corner and a list of every available
                  feature shows up. In the bottom of the page you have shortcuts
                  for easier access. What I like about the interface is it's
                  user friendliness and it's ease of use. Unfortunately, that's
                  about it. Even though the app is regularly updated (every
                  month or two) it's obvious that design is not Starhub's main
                  concern. The user interface reminds me of an app from a
                  different era. It reminds me of apps I used to have on my
                  iPhone 3GS, and anyone who is fairly known with iPhone's know
                  that that was a long time ago. I can't understand why the
                  display size of the app is fixed to a small screen, instead of
                  dynamically adjusted to the actual screen size. As you can see
                  in the example pictures above, a lot of space is just blacked
                  out because of this. It's not something you usually see in
                  today's apps, and especially not in well-known and widespread
                  apps like Happy Prepaid. This together with the lack of
                  responsiveness brings down my overall impression of the app. </p>
                <p>All in all, Starhub's Happy Prepaid app is OK. It has all the
                  functionalities I could think of using and it's easy to use.
                  Downside of it is however obvious, it needs some
                  reconstruction and a serious interface update in order to keep
                  up with today's customer expectations. </p>

                <p>So who is this brilliant mastermind behind the idea and
                  creation of AppAdvisor? I'll answer that question for you. My
                  name is <strong>Jakob Schub</strong>, I'm a technology expert
                  with a master's degree in computer science and a great
                  interest for new, trendy mobile applications. I grew up in
                  Sweden but since my early 20's I've lived all around the
                  world. South Africa, Singapore, India, Taiwan, you name it and
                  I've probably already lived there. I do a lot of traveling
                  while doing what I love, creating content for my followers. </p>
